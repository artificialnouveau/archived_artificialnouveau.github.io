title: "Smartphone and Wearable Sensors for the Estimation of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Disease Severity: Cross-sectional Study"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/fshd1
excerpt: 'We aimed to build a tool that estimates FSHD clinical severity based on behavioral features captured using smartphone and remote sensor data. The adoption of remote monitoring tools, such as smartphones and wearables, would provide a novel opportunity for continuous, passive, and objective monitoring of FSHD symptom severity outside the clinic.'
