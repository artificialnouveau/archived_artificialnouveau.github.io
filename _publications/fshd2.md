title: "Objective Monitoring of Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy During Clinical Trials Using a Smartphone App and Wearables: Observational Study"
permalink: /publication/fshd2
excerpt: 'This study investigated the feasibility of using smartphones and wearables to capture symptoms related to FSHD based on a continuous collection of multiple features, such as the number of steps, sleep, and app use. We also identified features that can be used to differentiate between patients with FSHD and non-FSHD controls.'
