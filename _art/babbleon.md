“Babble tapes” are digital audio files that are played in the background of a conversation in order to defeat audio surveillance. They often contain sounds of other humans speaking unintelligibly. Babble noise is considered to be one of the best noises for masking speech as the masking noises and the conversations of interest share the same acoustic properties. However today, with advanced multi-speaker identification algorithms, it may be easier than ever to extract conversations from the speakers of interest from the babble noise.

BabbleOn is a small web-based interactive installation that enables audience members to create their own babble tapes. In my proposed installation, audience members are invited to read 2-3 sentences into a microphone, their audio would then be sliced and remixed into personalized babble tapes containing the same audio properties of their own voices. Audience members can then download their own babble tapes in case they need to disguise their conversations from future audio surveillance.

Example of a personalized babble file:
