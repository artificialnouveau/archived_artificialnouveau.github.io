Mara Karagianni and Ahnjili worked on the tree sort algorithm, introduced by An and Gijs. The initial ideas were about combining the concept of tree branches and the tree sort algorithm to map plants’ names, their year of publication, and including non-scientific content from online forums. The latter, we thought would bring some everyday narration to an otherwise very academic and abstract process of how trees are categorized and named, a methodology developed by Linnaeus in 18th century, amended and further developed in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, which entails the rules of plant naming. However it’s still considered biased as to the syntax and categorization followed.
