rom Steven Jonas who organized the Quantified Self conference: 

Ahnjili came  across a study on the menstrual cycle’s influence on cognition and  emotion and was curious to see how hormonal changes may affect her  day-to-day behavior. She figured her internet use may be a convenient  and easy data set to assemble and examine for this effect. Using a few Chrome plugins, Ahnjili was able to see not only where she spent her time online, but how she interacted with sites like Facebook and Youtube. 

Her analysis yielded some interesting patterns. She found the most  distinctive behaviors occurred during the fertile window, a span of  about six days in the menstrual cycle when the body is most ready for  conception. In this talk, Ahnjili shows the differences in how she browsed Facebook, swiped in Tinder, and listened to music on YouTube.
