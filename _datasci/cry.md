I wrote two algorithms for detecting crying and coughing using smartphone microphones for hospital and at home settings. These two algorithms were published in two journals: 

[Development and technical validation of a smartphone-based cry detection algorithm](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2021.651356/full)

[Development and technical validation of a smartphone-based pediatric cough detection algorithm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppul.25801)
