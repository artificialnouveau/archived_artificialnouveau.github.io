# Face Anonymization Using Python

## Objective

With the exponential rise in the use of digital platforms and machine learning models, the concern for privacy has never been more important. One of the key areas where privacy needs to be maintained is in dealing with images, particularly those containing faces. The objective of this project was to develop an application that provides different methods for face anonymization, a crucial step in preserving privacy in an era where facial recognition technologies are widely used.

## Target Audience

This application is targeted towards anyone who needs to anonymize faces in images for reasons such as privacy, confidentiality, or data protection. This can range from data scientists who are preparing datasets for machine learning models, to businesses that handle sensitive user data, to individuals who want to maintain their privacy.

## How It Works

I developed a set of Python scripts that utilize the OpenCV library for face detection and image processing. The scripts provide six different methods for face anonymization:

1. **Black Bar:** Overlays a black rectangle over each detected face.

2. **Pixelate:** Pixelates the region of each detected face.

3. **Blur:** Applies a blur effect over each detected face.

4. **Face Swap:** Swaps the faces. If there is only one face, it throws an error. It can handle multiple faces in the image.

5. **Emoji:** Replaces each face with an emoji.

6. **Eye Color:** Changes the eye color to the average color of the face.

Each script reads images from a specified input directory, applies the face anonymization method, and writes the anonymized images to a specified output directory.

Furthermore, I built a GUI using the Tkinter library, which provides a user-friendly way to select the anonymization method and the input/output directories.

## Conclusion

While these scripts are relatively simple and may not handle all possible variations of images, they serve as a solid foundation for anyone looking to delve deeper into the field of image anonymization. The project underlines the importance of privacy preservation and showcases how Python, along with libraries such as OpenCV and Tkinter, can be used to achieve it. Future work could aim at improving the accuracy of face detection and the quality of face anonymization, as well as adding more anonymization methods.
