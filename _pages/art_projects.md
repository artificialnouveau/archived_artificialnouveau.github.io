A Blended Voice: Shibboleth (WIP)
======
<br/><img src='/images/blending_voices.png'>

In collaboration with Effi and Amir (of By The Throat), we are currently exploring how to blend the voices of these two artists as a single voice. We used coqui's tacotron and tortoise-tts to generate the voices. For more info, see: https://effiandamir.net/index.php?id=538 .


Fashion Police Drones (WIP)
=====
When does automated policing go too far? To explore the boundaries, I explored how the fashion police would deploy their automated surveillance algorithms on drones to identify fashion crimes. Once the camera on the (Trello) drone has identified the fashion crime, it will follow that target continuously.

Here is the Git Repo for my computer vision fashion crime identification code. Still working out the kinks of my fashion police drone! Will upload it soon!

Here are some examples of past and current fashion laws:

    France currently has a burqa ban.

    In Sudan, women must wear dresses and socks.

    In Qatar, clothes must cover shoulders and be lower than knees. Soles of feet or shoes should not be shown. 

    Iranian law states that "anyone who explicitly violates any religious taboo in public" will be imprisoned for up to two months, or flogged with 74 lashes. In practice, women must cover their hair with a headscarf and their arms and legs with loose clothing.

    The government of Iran has banned "Western hair styles" for men, including ponytails, mullets, and spikes.

    In Iraq, between 6 to 70 young men were kidnapped, tortured, and murdered in Baghdad and Iraq after a campaign against Iraqi teenage boys who dressed in an emo style. 

    In some southern U.S. states, in the earliest 21st century,  sagging of the trousers (wearing of trousers so low as to expose the underwear) was banned in some places.
    
    
Future Wake

Future Wake (www.futurewake.com) repurposes predictive policing algorithms to predict future police-related fatal encounters.
