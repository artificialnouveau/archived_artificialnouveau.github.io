  * Artificial Nouveau
  * Participated in talks, panels and juries for events focused on machine learning and ethics.
  * Developed custom analytical and generative algorithms for creative application:
   * Used Coqui’s Tacotron2 and VITs to create a custom TTS model
   * Used DeepFaceLab to create a personalized deepfake commercial
  * Developed a series of data mining, generative AI, computer vision, and machine learning-focused
workshops:

Art Awards
======
* Mozilla Creative Media Awards: Future Wake (2021)
  * Future Wake (www.futurewake.com) is an interactive art project turns the practice of predictive policing upside down, instead, it allows citizens to predict police brutality. I used to machine learning to predict who, when and how the next victim would die. Further, I used deepfake algorithms to generate the faces of the next victims.


Art Residencies
======
* IMPAKT: CODE (2023)
  * TBD

* Anais Berck (2022)
  * During the residency we developed algoliterary publications. These are publishing experiments with algorithms and
literary, scientific, and activist datasets about trees and nature. We ask ourselves: who and what is excluded, made invisible
or exploited in the existent representations, discourses, tools, and practices? To address these questions, we used decision
tree algorithms, we sorted the histories of tree nomenclature.


Funded Art Projects
======
* Shibboleth (2022)
  * We produced a ‘dual voice’ - that transforms fluidly from a recognizable voice of Speaker A to a voice of a Speaker B
while speaking. With the "switch" happening at points of sonic uncertainty in the voice output, where a certain articulation
or tonal quality could belong to either speaker. To do this, we created custom Text-To-Speech algorithms using Coqui.

Teaching

* iii: Introduction to Generative Art
  * In this workshop, participants learned about how to use and customize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for text-to-text generation, text-to-image generation, and image-to-image generation. No coding experience was necessary, as I provided Python code to customize the GANs.


* HKU University of the Arts Utrecht: INtroduction to computer vision and surveillance for photography students (2022) 
  * Computer vision algorithms can extract a wide variety of visual features from images. These algorithms have been used to detect adult content, violent images, identify specific brands, and to identify and analyze human faces. In course, participants learned to see an image through the eye of a computer. We exploref how computers extract information such as biometrics, emotions, objects, and locations.
