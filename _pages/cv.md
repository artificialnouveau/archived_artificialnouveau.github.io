* Ph.D in Clinical Neuropharmacology & Applied Data Analytics, Leiden University, 2034 (expected)


Work experience
======
* September 2018 - Ongoing: Data Scientist
  * Centre for Human Drug Research
  * My main research objective was to perform disease classification and disease severity estimation from smartphone, wearable, and electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePro) data using machine learning (with Python and R on Azure DevOps)
  * Created the Trial@Home Python library, which is used to visualize, clean, generate, and analyze features from the Trial@Home raw data
  * Experience with writing Statistical Analysis Protocols and applying for IRB ethics

* January 2018: Data Scientist and Science Communicator
  * Artificial Nouveau
  * Participated in talks, panels and juries for events focused on machine learning and ethics.
  * Developed custom analytical and generative algorithms for creative application:
   * Used Coqui’s Tacotron2 and VITs to create a custom TTS model
   * Used DeepFaceLab to create a personalized deepfake commercial
  * Developed a series of data mining, generative AI, computer vision, and machine learning-focused
workshops:
    * Hello Google, do you know why I’m sad?
    * AI pickup artist: How to train your facial recognition algorithm
    * Introduction to Machine Learning for Clinical Trials

* October 2017: Data Scientist
  * Global Drug Survey
  * Responsible for maintaining quality reference data using SQL by performing operations such as cleaning,
transformation and ensuring integrity in a relational environment
  * Designed interactive data visualizations for ongoing analyses, dashboards, reports in both Tableau
and Javascript
  

Art Awards
======
* Mozilla Creative Media Awards: Future Wake (2021)
  * Future Wake (www.futurewake.com) is an interactive art project turns the practice of predictive policing upside down, instead, it allows citizens to predict police brutality. I used to machine learning to predict who, when and how the next victim would die. Further, I used deepfake algorithms to generate the faces of the next victims.


Art Residencies
======
* IMPAKT: CODE (2023)
  * TBD

* Anais Berck (2022)
  * During the residency we developed algoliterary publications. These are publishing experiments with algorithms and
literary, scientific, and activist datasets about trees and nature. We ask ourselves: who and what is excluded, made invisible
or exploited in the existent representations, discourses, tools, and practices? To address these questions, we used decision
tree algorithms, we sorted the histories of tree nomenclature.


Funded Art Projects
======
* Shibboleth (2022)
  * We produced a ‘dual voice’ - that transforms fluidly from a recognizable voice of Speaker A to a voice of a Speaker B
while speaking. With the "switch" happening at points of sonic uncertainty in the voice output, where a certain articulation
or tonal quality could belong to either speaker. To do this, we created custom Text-To-Speech algorithms using Coqui.

[...I'll eventually get around to adding all of my talks prior to 2022...]
* Data Summit 2022

Teaching
======

* iii: Introductio to Generative Art
  * In this workshop, participants learned about how to use and customize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for text-to-text generation, text-to-image generation, and image-to-image generation. No coding experience was necessary, as I provided Python code to customize the GANs.


* HKU University of the Arts Utrecht: INtroduction to computer vision and surveillance for photography students (2022) 
  * Computer vision algorithms can extract a wide variety of visual features from images. These algorithms have been used to detect adult content, violent images, identify specific brands, and to identify and analyze human faces. In course, participants learned to see an image through the eye of a computer. We exploref how computers extract information such as biometrics, emotions, objects, and locations.
