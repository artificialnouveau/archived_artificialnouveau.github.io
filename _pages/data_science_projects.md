Coughing and Crying Detection
======

I wrote two algorithms for detecting crying and coughing using smartphone microphones for hospital and at home settings. These two algorithms were published in two journals: 

[Development and technical validation of a smartphone-based cry detection algorithm](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2021.651356/full)

[Development and technical validation of a smartphone-based pediatric cough detection algorithm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ppul.25801)


Global Drug Survey
=====

[Global Drug Survey (GDS)](https://www.globaldrugsurvey.com/) runs the worlds biggest drug survey. We produce reports for global media, public health and corporate organisations. GDS use its data and expertise to create digital health applications delivering screening and brief interventions for drugs and alcohol. We create free online harm reduction resources and anonymous, confidential self-assessment tools. GDS also produces a range of drug education materials for health and legal professionals, the entertainment industry and the general public


Here Be Monsters: Deep Faking Nixon
=====

From Jeff who organized the project:

On this episode of Here Be Monsters, Francesca and Halsey tell producer Jeff Emtman that deepfakes aren’t going to rupture society.  We’ve dealt with this before, whether it’s darkroom manipulations or photoshop, societies eventually learn how to detect deception.  But the adjustment period can be rough, and they hope that In Event of Moon Disaster will help educate media consumers on the danger of taking media at face value, regardless of whether it’s deepfakes or just old-fashioned photo mis-captioning.

Also on this episode, Ahnjili explains how computers learn to speak, and we listen to some audio examples of how computer voices can fail, using examples from the paper Location-Relative Attention Mechanisms For Robust Long-Form Speech Synthesis.  Also heard: a presidential  parody deepfake from user Stable Voices on Youtube.

Master Thesis: Pharmacological and Behavioral Interventions for Focus: The Comparison of Reversal Learning Under the Influence of Lysergic Acid Diethylmide (LSD), Methylphenidate (MPH) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy
=====
[Link to my thesis](https://github.com/artificialnouveau/ReversalLearning_LSD_Methylphenidate_Mindfulness/blob/main/Ahnjili_ZhuParris_MSc_Thesis.pdf)

The ability to learn and flexibly adapt behavior in response to salient changes in the surrounding environment is a fundamental skill for survival. Cognitive rigidity is characteristic of many mental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and drug addiction. Psychoactive medications and cognitive therapies have attempted to treat cognitive rigidity by altering learning and feedback processing.

The aim of this study is to assess if pharmacological and behavioral interventions differently alter the ability to learn and unlearn stimulus-outcome contingencies and feedback sensitivity. Specifically, we will assess how small doses of methylphenidate (MPH) (n=102), lysergic acid diethylmide (LSD) (n=19) and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) (n=110) affect reversal learning. All participants completed a Probabilistic Reversal Learning (PRL) task which requires them to learn the different probabilities of receiving rewards and punishment for each of the three cues. Midway through the task, the probabilities are reversed and participants must now update the values associated with these cues. The PRL tasks provide a window on adaptive behavior, as it allows us to assess two crucial components: (1) the (in)ability to reverse well-learnt responses (‘perseverative behavior’), and (2) immediate behavioral adaptation following motivational outcomes (‘feedback sensitivity’).


Menstrual Cycles, 50 Cent, Right Swipes
=====

From Steven Jonas who organized the Quantified Self conference: 

Ahnjili came  across a study on the menstrual cycle’s influence on cognition and  emotion and was curious to see how hormonal changes may affect her  day-to-day behavior. She figured her internet use may be a convenient  and easy data set to assemble and examine for this effect. Using a few Chrome plugins, Ahnjili was able to see not only where she spent her time online, but how she interacted with sites like Facebook and Youtube. 

Her analysis yielded some interesting patterns. She found the most  distinctive behaviors occurred during the fertile window, a span of  about six days in the menstrual cycle when the body is most ready for  conception. Looking at her shopping data from a clothing website:

     “I found that there was no change in the amount of money  I spent or the amount of time I shopped online… but while I was most  fertile, I bought more red items. In fact, it was the only time I bought  red items.”

In this talk, Ahnjili shows the differences in how she browsed Facebook, swiped in Tinder, and listened to music on YouTube.
