Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of computer vision using Python, tailored specifically for photography students. Through practical examples and hands-on projects, students will learn how computer vision techniques can enhance their understanding of images, automate certain tasks, and unleash creative possibilities in the field of photography. No prior programming experience is required, making it accessible for beginners.

Course Outline:

1. Introduction to Computer Vision
   - Overview of computer vision and its applications in photography
   - Basic concepts and terminology in computer vision
   - Introduction to popular libraries and tools used in computer vision with Python (e.g., OpenCV)

2. Object and Face Detection and Recognition
   - Introduction to object detection and its importance in photography
   - Understanding the concept of image features and keypoints
   - Implementing object detection algorithms (e.g., Haar cascades, SIFT, SURF) for common objects in photographs

3. Image Segmentation and Background Removal
   - Techniques for segmenting images into meaningful regions
   - Background removal methods for isolating subjects or objects
   - Hands-on exercises on segmenting images and removing backgrounds using Python

By the end of this course, photography students will have gained a solid foundation in computer vision techniques using Python. They will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to leverage computer vision tools to enhance their photography workflow, automate tasks, and explore new creative possibilities.
