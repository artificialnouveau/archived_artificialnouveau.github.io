The ability to learn and flexibly adapt behavior in response to salient changes in the surrounding environment is a fundamental skill for survival. Cognitive rigidity is characteristic of many mental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and drug addiction. Psychoactive medications and cognitive therapies have attempted to treat cognitive rigidity by altering learning and feedback processing.

The aim of this study is to assess if pharmacological and behavioral interventions differently alter the ability to learn and unlearn stimulus-outcome contingencies and feedback sensitivity. Specifically, we will assess how small doses of methylphenidate (MPH) (n=102), lysergic acid diethylmide (LSD) (n=19) and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) (n=110) affect reversal learning. All participants completed a Probabilistic Reversal Learning (PRL) task which requires them to learn the different probabilities of receiving rewards and punishment for each of the three cues. Midway through the task, the probabilities are reversed and participants must now update the values associated with these cues. The PRL tasks provide a window on adaptive behavior, as it allows us to assess two crucial components: (1) the (in)ability to reverse well-learnt responses (‘perseverative behavior’), and (2) immediate behavioral adaptation following motivational outcomes (‘feedback sensitivity’).
